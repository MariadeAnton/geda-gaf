	*: New library Libgedawidgets created for widgets previously built in
	the gschem subtres. Some of these widgets are custom widget directly
        derived from the cooresponding gtk version. Some widgets are replacements
        forked from the gtk sources in	order to eliminate depreciation warnings,
        even though gtk continues to maintain. Some of these widgets provide GTK3
        functionality where none exist in GTK2. Libgedawidgets is linked against
        GTK2 and is intended to provide "gtk" like resources to geda-gaf any
        application without depreciating the entire free world.
