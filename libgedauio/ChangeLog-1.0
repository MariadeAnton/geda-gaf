        * include/geda_comboboxtext.h: Add GtkWidget *button variable to
        _GedaComboBoxText structure, eliminate variable 'priv" because this
        was not being used.

        * src/widgets/geda_comboboxtext.c: Add callback function to save
        a pointer to the internal button object. Set the button to not be
        focusable by default, this was annoying.

        * src/widgets/geda_handlebox.c: Floating tool-bars were not staying on
        top, used to work fine, Gtk must have "fixed". Added HINT GDK_WINDOW_
        TYPE_HINT_DOCK in function geda_handle_box_realize, also added gdk_
        window_set_transient_for in attempt to by-pass Gtk and work with Gdk
        directly, seems to work again.

        * src/widgets/geda_entry.c: Fix history, again. Added have_history to
          to entry struc (but kept the old history for construction purposes).

        * src/*/*.c: Redo inclusion of header files

        * *: More work on Doxygen documentation; Changed group delimiters to
          use a different style than function documentation, add and end group
          use the double asterisk, as oppose to the asterisk exclamation pair
          so as to allow independent indexing and while searching documentation
          comments. Fixed doxygen warnings.

	*: Redo .gitignore files

	*dialog/*: Add new directory and file geda_input_dialog.c for generic input
         dialogs.

	*: New library Libgedawidgets created for widgets previously built in
	the gschem subtres. Some of these widgets are custom widget directly
        derived from the cooresponding gtk version. Some widgets are replacements
        forked from the gtk sources in	order to eliminate depreciation warnings,
        even though gtk continues to maintain. Some of these widgets provide GTK3
        functionality where none exist in GTK2. Libgedawidgets is linked against
        GTK2 and is intended to provide "gtk" like resources to geda-gaf any
        application without depreciating the entire free world.
