2014-11-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_menu_button.c: Try gtk_widget_get_window instead of
        gtk_button_get_event_window

2014-11-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_handlebox.c: Use mgdk_window_get_size when gdk_window_get_width
        and gdk_window_get_height are not available

2014-11-20 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * include/geda_keysyms.h: New file for gdk_keysym defines

2014-11-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_combobox.c: Change gdk_window_get_display to
        gdk_drawable_get_display in function popup_grab_on_window

2014-11-19 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_label.c: Replace glist_free_full with g_list_foreach
        g_list_free in function parse_uri_markup and geda_label_clear_links.

2014-11-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/*.c: Revise and update Doxygen documentation

2014-11-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_font_dialog.c: Do not destroy the font map in
        geda_font_dialog_finalize. Or else unreliable glibc will report:

        g_object_unref: assertion G_IS_OBJECT Failed

        when eda_renderer_dispose unreferences the layout if the sub-dialog
        is ever viewed, when gschem shuts down, even though PANGO_IS_LAYOUT
        and G_IS_OBJECT return true in the disposer and yes that was so fun
        to track down. That's glibc wasting another 6 hours of my life, as
        typical. Reaffirming my conviction that the less g's in the source
        code the better.

      * src/widgets/geda_bulb.c: New GedaBulb widget, similar to GtkRadio but
        is not derived from GtkRadio, is alternative replacement derived from
        GtkCheckButton. The GedaBulb class is intended to replace the current
        kludged scheme with radio like widgets build with macros but resolves
        many of the short-comings of GtkRadio, even when compared to Gtk-3.x.
        The class contains xpm data, no images are loaded from disk. The xpm
        data is used to create shared pixmaps, with the pixel data released
        when the last GedaBulb is destroyed, thus using the heap space more
        efficiently and still out performing GtkRadio. Unlike with GtkRadio,
        groups of GedaBulb are easy to create and manage! Bulbs only emit a
        "clicked" signal when actually clicked and can be set without signal
        emissions. The class has more extensive and more practical methods,
        and accessible properties and better documentation.

2014-09-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_combobox.c: Add doxygen grouping for GedaComboBox

        and geda_file_chooser_get_entry_text.

2014-09-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * A new widget GedaTreeView derived from GtkTreeview in to relocate
        support function from gschem, where the function did not belong.

      * include/geda_tree_view.h: New header file for GedaTreeView widget

      * src/widgets/geda_tree_view.c: New source file implements GedaTreeView.

2014-08-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * docs/libgedauio.dox: Generate TAGFILES files for libgedauio in the
        output directory. Redirect errors and warnings to log.

      * src/dialogs/geda_file_chooser.c: Reformat Doxygen codes and cleanup
        source documentation, also general clean-up.

      * src/widgets/geda_combobox.c: Reformat Doxygen codes and cleanup
        source documentation.

      * src/widgets/geda_comboboxtext.c: Reformat Doxygen codes and cleanup
        source documentation.

2014-08-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_comboboxtext.c: Do NOT emit "changed" when user types
        in the entry, this renders the signal worthless.

2014-08-18 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_comboboxtext.c: Enhanced widget; add FORMAT_ENTRY_TEXT.
        and other updates from gtk-3.4

      * src/functions: New module group with inaugural modules geda_accumulate.c
        and geda_marshal.c.

      * include/geda_uio_functions.h: New header includes uio the functions, can
        be included without having to include the entire library.

2014-08-16 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_comboboxtext.c: New file, provides replacement for
        GtkComboBox.

2014-08-15 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * src/widgets/geda_comboboxtext.c: Set store directly in function
        geda_combo_box_text_insert, no need to call gtk_combo_box_insert_text.

2014-08-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * include/geda_comboboxtext.h: Add geda_combo_box_text_set_activate_default
        and geda_combo_box_text_get_entry, expose entry.

      * src/widgets/geda_comboboxtext.c: Add new function geda_combo_box_text
        _set_activate_default and geda_combo_box_text_get_entry.

2014-08-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * dialogs/geda_file_chooser.c: In get EdaConfig in save and restore and
        eliminate as parameter, ditch custom marshal, and for god sake, block
        GtkFileChooserDialog from resizing the dialog. Implement save and
        restore unfunctionality using Libgeda.

      * include/geda_file_chooser.h: Add declarations for new function, and
        FileChooserAction enumerators.

2014-08-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * dialogs/geda_file_chooser.c: Extend new GedaFileChooser class by
        adding property getter and setter, just got one property for now:
        "filter-index". Changed signal type to geda_file_chooser_get_type
        class id.

      * include/geda_file_chooser.h: Relocated IDE_FILTER, yet again, this
        time maybe for good, put in include/geda_enum.h so gschem/i_vars.c
        could access to set default if error retrieving setting.

2014-08-06 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * dialogs/geda_file_chooser.c: New source file is implementation for
        GedaFileChooser; a dialog class derived from GtkFileChooserDialog
        with filters for Geda types (from gschem x_fileselect). The custom
        class provides direct access to the filter combo button.

      * include/geda_file_filter.h: Header file to support new GedaFile
        Chooser dialog, formally x_fileselect.h without the enumerators.

      * include/geda_file_chooser.h: New header file to support the new
        GedaFileChooser class.

      * include/geda_widgets.h: Added geda_file_chooser.h (but not geda_
        file_filter.h.

2014-08-01 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * include/geda_comboboxtext.h: Add GtkWidget *button variable to
        _GedaComboBoxText structure, eliminate variable 'priv" because this
        was not being used.

        * src/widgets/geda_comboboxtext.c: Add callback function to save
        a pointer to the internal button object. Set the button to not be
        focusable by default, this was annoying.

2014-07-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/widgets/geda_handlebox.c: Floating tool-bars were not staying on
        top, used to work fine, Gtk must have "fixed". Added HINT GDK_WINDOW_
        TYPE_HINT_DOCK in function geda_handle_box_realize, also added gdk_
        window_set_transient_for in attempt to by-pass Gtk and work with Gdk
        directly, seems to work again.

2014-07-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/widgets/geda_entry.c: Fix history, again. Added have_history to
          to entry struc (but kept the old history for construction purposes).

2014-07-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/*/*.c: Redo inclusion of header files

2014-07-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * *: More work on Doxygen documentation; Changed group delimiters to
          use a different style than function documentation, add and end group
          use the double asterisk, as oppose to the asterisk exclamation pair
          so as to allow independent indexing and while searching documentation
          comments. Fixed doxygen warnings.

2014-07-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

	*: Redo .gitignore files

	*dialog/*: Add new directory and file geda_input_dialog.c for generic input
         dialogs.

2014-03-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

	*: New library Libgedawidgets created for widgets previously built in
	the gschem subtres. Some of these widgets are custom widget directly
        derived from the cooresponding gtk version. Some widgets are replacements
        forked from the gtk sources in	order to eliminate depreciation warnings,
        even though gtk continues to maintain. Some of these widgets provide GTK3
        functionality where none exist in GTK2. Libgedawidgets is linked against
        GTK2 and is intended to provide "gtk" like resources to geda-gaf any
        application without depreciating the entire free world.
