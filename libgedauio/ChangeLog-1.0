        * *: More work on Doxygen documentation; Changed group delimiters to
          use a different style than function documentation, add and end group
          use the double asterisk, as oppose to the asterisk exclamation pair
          so as to allow independent indexing and while searching documentation
          comments. Fixed doxygen warnings.

	*: New library Libgedawidgets created for widgets previously built in
	the gschem subtres. Some of these widgets are custom widget directly
        derived from the cooresponding gtk version. Some widgets are replacements
        forked from the gtk sources in	order to eliminate depreciation warnings,
        even though gtk continues to maintain. Some of these widgets provide GTK3
        functionality where none exist in GTK2. Libgedawidgets is linked against
        GTK2 and is intended to provide "gtk" like resources to geda-gaf any
        application without depreciating the entire free world.
