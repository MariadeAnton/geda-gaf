  What is libgedauio?\includegraphics[scale=1]{./tools.png}

  Libgedauio is a collection of User Interface Objects, sometimes referred to as widgets.
  This collection is available for use in programs within the gEDA suite of applications.
  The UI Objects in Libgedauio are either derived from larger external libraries so
  that the objects could be customized for specific needs of gEDA applications or the
  objects were adopted from external libraries because the maintainers of the external
  libraries listed the objects as depreciated.
