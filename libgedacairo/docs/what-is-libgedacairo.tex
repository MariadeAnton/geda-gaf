 What is libgEDAcairo?\includegraphics[scale=1]{./libgedacairo.png} 

  The libgedacairo library provides a renderer for the gEDA suite of applications to render schematics and symbols based on the Cairo vector graphics library and the Pango font library. Data for rendering is loaded using libgeda. 


  The library does *not* provide a rendering widget for programs, although it could be used to implement one. The library is intended for more general rendering usage, e.g. to screen, to printers, or to various image formats. Libgedacairo is based on Peter Clifton's preexisting gschem rendering code. Please submit bug reports and patches to , using the `libgedacairo' tag.
