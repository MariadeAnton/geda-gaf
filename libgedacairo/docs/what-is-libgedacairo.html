  What is libgEDAcairo?<img src="libgedacairo.png" width="126" height="192" alt="Welcome to Libgedacairo" style="float: right; " />
  <p/>
  The libgedacairo library provides a renderer for the gEDA suite of applications to
  render schematics and symbols based on the Cairo vector graphics library and the
  Pango font library. Data for rendering is loaded using libgeda.
  <p/>
  The library does *not* provide a rendering widget for programs, although
  it could be used to implement one. The library is intended for more
  general rendering usage, e.g. to screen, to printers, or to various
  image formats.
  <p/>
  Libgedacairo is based on Peter Clifton's preexisting gschem rendering code.
