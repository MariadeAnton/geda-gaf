        * src/Makefile.am: Change -I$(abs_top_builddir)/include to
        -I$(top_srcdir)/include. Don't know where i got abs_top_build.
        Does not work for distcheck or on Mint (and probably Ubuntu) with
        automake ver? autoconf v?

        * libgedacairo: Created subfolders src and include and coresponding
          Makefile.am: Revised "includes" again, the gsymcheck_CPPFLAGS
        was not past to C with some installations. Used AM_CFLAGS instead.
