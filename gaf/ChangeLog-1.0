        * src/ChangeLog-1.0: Created new change log file!

        * src/Makefile.am: Change -I$(abs_top_builddir)/include to
        -I$(top_srcdir)/include. Don't know where i got abs_top_build.
        Added $(BUILT_SOURCES) to EXTRA_DIST, Don't know correct way to
        resolve but this seems to pass distro checks.
