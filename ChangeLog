	* All:Re-organinzed all Makefiles.am's to improve reliabilty of header
          inclusions and to some what "standardize" the use of automake flags.
          Various fixes, see change indivual change-logs. Entire code tree once
          again compiles without ANY errors or warnings. Added AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
          ([nostdinc -Woverride -Wportability -Wsyntax -Wunsupported]), 
          AM_PROG_CC_C_O option m4_ifdef([AM_SILENT_RULES],[AM_SILENT_RULES([yes])])
          and AX_CHECK_PANGO to configure.ac. Also added final echoing of
          configuration summary.
