This is a utility script used to remove reference designators from gEDA schematic files. unannotate can be invoked as a normal command function using various options and directives or the utility can be used with redirection operations. Note that not all options or directives are available with all modes of operation, for example Quite mode is activated automatically when streaming data. Auto and Batch operations are supported. The command mode is set by how the command is invoked.

Basic command operations is invoked with "normal" command syntax; <command [options] filename>. Batch mode is automatically enabled when the command is invoked with "batch" command syntax; <command [option] filename1 filename2 filename3....>. All file names passed as arguments are ignored if the --all options is used. See Parameters for more details.

.IP "-u, --usage"
Displays examples on usage"
.IP "-V, --version"
Displays software version information"
.IP "-x, --example"
Show examples of usage'

.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP "-a, --all"
Process all schematics in the current folder. All filenames arguments will be ignored.
.IP "-i, --input"
Specify the name of the input file. Use of "-i" is optional and is only required of the output file name is also specified. If the file extension is "sch" then the filename need not include the extension.
.IP "-o, --output"
Specify the name of the output file. If an output name is not specified then the input file name will be used for the output unless the --no-overwrite directive is used, in which case the input file name is still used but the letters "new" will be added to the end of the file name.
.IP "-b, --no-backup"
Do not make backup copies of input files. By default input files are copied to <input-file-name>.sav before processing. The --no-backup directive can be used to disable this feature.
.IP "-t, --no-overwrite"
Do not overwrite any existing output files. This directive is applicable when the output file name is specified. By default the output will over write existing files. If the --no-overwrite directive is used then output file names will be appended with "new" if a file with the same name already exist.
.IP "-v, --verbose"
Display additional information during processing. Verbose mode is not recommended when using redirection.
.IP "-q, --quite"
Suppress output messages

.SH OPTIONS
The current version of unannotate support the following command-line options
.IP "-e, --extension"
Change file extension of the input files, default="sch"
.IP "-f, --filter"
Change the file filter, default="*". Warning, using this directive enables Auto-mode, i.e. --all. The --filter option is the same as --all with no filter specification. Note that the filter parameter must enclosed in double-quotes, see examples. This similar to invoking the command with <command prog1*.sch>, without quotes but is not the exactly the same. Using unquoted wild-cards would result in the shell expanding the names prior to invoking the command and this would enable Batch mode. If the -all or --filter option had been use then the all of the names result from the expansion would be ignored.
