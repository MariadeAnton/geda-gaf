.SH NAME
bompp \- Format a gEDA Bill of Materials (BOM) file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bompp bomfile >output

.RI [ OPTIONS ] None

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bompp

This is a utility script to format BOM files produced by gnetlist. The bom parameters for gnetlist should be device, value, footprint, refdes. One way this can be done is to create a text file with each of these attributes on separate lines and name the file "attribs". This file should look like this:

device
value
footprint
refdes

In the directory containing the file named "attribs", issue a command like:

gnetlist -g bom -o temp.bom /path/example.sch (omit path if the schematic is in the same directory)

This will create the raw bom file "temp.bom". Alternativly, the bom could be generated without the "attribs" file by invoking gnetlist like:

gnetlist  -g bom -o temp.bom example.sch -Oattribs=device,value,footprint,refdes

Then bompp can be used to produce a formated bom using a command like:

bompp temp.bom >example.bom

bompp adds the following headers:

Device", "Value", "Footprint", "Urefs

and aligns the data in columns under the headers.
