This directory contains the testsuite for the "gxyrs" script.
If the script is modified, tests should be added here.
If a bug report is filed, a test should be added to show the bug
before the bug is fixed.

If you require additional input files, add them in the inputs/ directory.
Reference output files go in outputs/.  Add the test description to
tests.list.
