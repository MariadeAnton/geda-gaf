    * sch/gTAG-ucont.sch: Update footprint for conn4 (delete attached
      footprint).

    * sch/gTAG-psu.sch: Replace zero ohm resistors R30 and R31 with
      1N5817 Schottky diodes, adjust attribute positions and visibilities.

    * sch/gTAG-psu.sch: Clean-up drawing; adjust attribute positions
      visibility, add net names gtag_input_power and MAX882_LBI.

	* Updated all files to the latest gEDA/gaf version and cleaned
      drawings, aka revised attribute positions and visibility.

	* Updated all symbols latest footprints, capitalizing symbol file
      names, replaced local complexes.

	* Reorganized example creating sub-directories bom/ sch/ sht/ sym/
      and ps and located files into the new sub-directories. Everything
      seems to work okay and this shows user a method that can be used
      to organize project files.

	* crdist.sh: Updated script to use gTAG_Files variable, this seems
      more maintainable.

    * gafrc: Update search directories.

2003-05-22  Ales Hvezda (ahvezda@seul.org)

	* Updated all sym/sch files to the latest gEDA/gaf version.

2003-01-11  Ales Hvezda (ahvezda@seul.org)

	* Updated all files to the current gEDA/gaf file formats.

	* Corrected CONN1 offset problem.

	* Re-ran gnetlist and recreated netlist and bom.

	* Added attribs file for bom generation.

	* Added gschlasrc file.

	* Removed COPYING (as it is now one directory higher)

	* Added Makefile.am and added all the files into SEUL gEDA cvs.

2001-02-12  Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* Added proper power-on-reset from the MAX882 to the u-controller
	  after suggestion from Luis Miguel Brugarolas <lmbruga@sire.es>.
	  R1 and C1 removed. Added is R33, R32 and R34. U30 is changed.


2001-02-11  Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* Added the lines
	  (hierarchy-netname-mangle "disabled")
          (hierarchy-uref-mangle "disabled")
	  to gnetlistrc so PCB likes the PCB netlist gnetlist generates.


2001-02-08  Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* Added C20 after suggestion from Andrew Dyer.
	* Changed distribution script so the generated PCB netlist is
	  called gTAG-pcb.net due to possible name clash with PCB layout.
	* Added R20-R23 after suggestion from Andrew Dyer.
