        * m4/geda_snprintf.m4: New file; Add macros to actually test vsnprintf and vnprintf before
          declaring victory, as opposed to just checking for existence of the library functions.

2015-08-11 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/geda-std-checks.m4: Check for functions vsnprintf and vasprintf.

2015-01-23 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/geda-std-checks.m4: Use check lib for rint instead of check function

2015-01-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/geda-x11.m4: Can not stop autoconf from making assumptions about X11, redo Xft
          flags

        * autogen.sh: Stop patch from making noise

2014-12-08 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

      * m4/geda-x11.m4: Revised FreeType with enable option, defaulting
        to off, at least for now. After optimization, the free-type font
        extension server is still too slow, roughly halve the performence
        of Cairo and the default XFont server. Still work in progress.

2014-11-27 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/geda-std-checks.m4: Add check header float.h in AX_GEDA_MATH, add checks
         for function strchr and strcspn in AX_GEDA_STR_FUNCS, add check for function
         atexit in AX_GEDA_MISC

        * m4/geda-libgedauio.m4: Rename libgedawidgets to libgedauio

        * m4/geda-x11.m4: New file to check to set X11 and Xft flags

2014-04-07 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/geda-stroke.m4: 2 Corrections:LIBSTROKE_CPPFLAGS to LIBSTROKE_CFLAGS in
          AC_SUBST and value in AC_DEFINE.

        * m4/geda-debug.m4: New file with content NOT relocated from existing file. The
          name should be self explanatory.

2014-03-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/geda-libgeda.m4: Moved out-of-place general checks to geda-std-checks.m4

2014-02-22 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/*: Add new files: as-ac-expand.m4, geda-directories.m4
          geda-python.m4, removed file geda-data-dirs.m4 with functionality relocated
          to geda-directories.m4

2013-10-31 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/*: Add new files: geda-automake-options.m4, geda-libgedathon.m4,
          geda-python.m4

2013-01-24 Wiley E Hill  <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/geda-gtk.m4: Add new mcro file and relocate modules checks for GTK and
          GDK bixbuf from configure.ac to new file, Added module check for GTHREAD
          because main-line included reference to HAVE_GTHREAD, which was not ever
          getting done because HAVE_GTHREAD was not in config.h

        * m4/geda-uri-viewer.m4: Revised so that SHOW_URI_COMMAND would be defined
          regardless of the out-come of SHOW_URI_GIO.

2013-01-06 Wiley E Hill  <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * m4/* REMARK: Added checks for functions to pacify autoscan, any sane
          compiler and standard libs will supply these functions.

        * m4/geda-std-checks.m4: New file, Relocate misc check from configure.ac
          and added additional checks.

        * m4/geda-gattrib.m4: Added Added AC_CHECK_FUNCS([memset]) which is also
          used by other compilation units. Technically, should disable module and
          continue with building.

        * m4/geda-libgeda.m4: Added checks for functions; memmove, size_t, sqrt,
          and AC_FUNC_LSTAT_FOLLOWS_SLASHED_SYMLINK, relocated AC_HEADER_SYS_WAI
          chown, strerror strstr, getlogin

          checks for functions strchr __argz_count __argz_next __argz_stringify])

        * m4/symbols-dirs.m4: Added new script to dynamically obtain a list
          of all subdirectories 1 level below the symbols directory so that
          autoconf can substitution the list during re-configuration. This
          well help to facilitate maintenance of the symbol libraries.
