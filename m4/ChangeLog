        * m4/geda-gtk.m4: Add new mcro file and relocate modules checks for GTK and
          GDK bixbuf from configure.ac to new file, Added module check for GTHREAD
          because main-line included reference to HAVE_GTHREAD, which was not ever
          getting done because HAVE_GTHREAD was not in config.h

        * m4/geda-uri-viewer.m4: Revised so that SHOW_URI_COMMAND would be defined
          regardless of the out-come of SHOW_URI_GIO.

        * m4/geda-libgeda.m4: Added checks for functions; memmove, size_t, sqrt,
          and AC_FUNC_LSTAT_FOLLOWS_SLASHED_SYMLINK, relocated AC_HEADER_SYS_WAI

	* m4/ChangeLog: Add this file!

        * m4/symbols-dirs.m4: Added new script to dynamically obtain a list
          of all subdirectories 1 level below the symbols directory so that
          autoconf can substitution the list during re-configuration. This
          well help to facilitate maintenance of the symbol libraries.
