	* m4/ChangeLog: Add this file!

        * m4/symbols-dirs.m4: Added new script to dynamically obtain a list
          of all subdirectories 1 level below the symbols directory so that
          autoconf can substitution the list during re-configuration. This
          well help to facilitate maintenance of the symbol libraries.
