        * /include/x_dialog_controls.h: Added DialogFont "Monospace 13.3" and
          PANGO_R5_LABEL, Changed GEDA_SWITCH and GTK_LABEL_HBOX so primary
          controls would use the new PANGO_R5_LABEL macro instead of GTK_R5
          _LABEL. GTK's "auto fit widget" Dialog architecture seems to conflict
          with the Linux principle "every thing is customizable on per users 
          basis" because changing the system gnome/gtk font style and size
          shifted  alignment of all the widgets in the dialog box and this
          is unacceptable. This revision "fixes" this issue by "fixing" font
          and the font size regardless of the user's settings.
