        * /include/geda_toolbars.h: Added TOOLBAR_GEDA_BUTTON macro to pass
          w_current instead of enumerated control ID (but most if not all of
          these could be phased out by using the TOOLBAR_STD_BUTTON [aka
          enumerated type] and defining a local handler to call the i_call
          back [aka menu] version. That would simplify i_callbacks.c by
          eliminating all of the redundant tool bar functions.
          Modified ToolbarButtonData structure to include icon data.
          Added documentation to improve clarity of nested macro scheme.

        * /include/x_dialog_controls.h: Added DialogFont "Monospace 13.3" and
          PANGO_R5_LABEL, Changed GEDA_SWITCH and GTK_LABEL_HBOX so primary
          controls would use the new PANGO_R5_LABEL macro instead of GTK_R5
          _LABEL. GTK's "auto fit widget" Dialog architecture seems to conflict
          with the Linux principle "every thing is customizable on per users 
          basis" because changing the system gnome/gtk font style and size
          shifted  alignment of all the widgets in the dialog box and this
          is unacceptable. This revision "fixes" this issue by "fixing" font
          and the font size regardless of the user's settings.

        * /include/geda_enum.h: Added IMAGE_TYPES
