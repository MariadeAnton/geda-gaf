        * /src/libgedathon.c: Replace mkdir with f_create_path in function
          Modified error message to include reason path creation failed.
          Not changing library revision because the change is insignificant.

        * *: More work on Doxygen documentation; Changed group delimiters to
          use a different style than function documentation, add and end group
          use the double asterisk, as oppose to the asterisk exclamation pair
          so as to allow independent indexing and while searching documentation
          comments.
