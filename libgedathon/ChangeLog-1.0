2015-02-28 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

    * scripts/gsym-snap-grid.py: New utility script rounds attribute X-Y location
      to align with a grid, default to multiples of 25 but can be specified as a
      command-line argument. Using libgeda for this might be little over-kill but
      script could potentially be expanded with additional features like setting
      alignments and this would be easier using library. (I should have created
      this along time ago, many hours lost cleaning symbol files and even those
      will need to be re-screened with the new utility.

      The setter in only functional within Ligedathon because Libgeda
      does not currently have the functionality to "set" the string
      with out recreating the path object. Needs more work setter, but
      getter is fully functional.

        * module/constants.c: Added constants for object types, not sure
          why these were not in orginal release, the python scripts used
          for development were lost. Well, here now.

2014-08-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * docs/libgedathon.dox: Generate TAGFILES files for libgedathon
          in the output directory. Redirect errors and warnings to log.

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * tests/run_tests.sh: Improve unit-test for Libgedathon.
          unit test now checks each of the three symbols files
          created for insertion into lpbf.sch for compliance using
          gsymcheck.

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/libgedathon.c: Uncommented s_object_add for children in
          PyGeda_add_object, don't remember why I did that, but was bug.
          Attributes added to floating pin objects were not being added
          to the object when the pin was commited to the page. Fixed Now.
          Did not affect pins whose attributes were added after the pin
          was committed to the page. Add in source comments and additional
          information in README.txt regarding being root.

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * module/geda.c: Revised module function new_pin, to accept either
          a string or an integer for the pin number argument using Python
          functions (sense the module does not have access to Libgeda).
          Previous commits changed the 6th argument from integer to type
          string. Now can be either and I think this is more convenient.
          This does however, makes new_pin unique in that it is the only
          module API function that derives a Python argument, other than
          the PyColor arguments, (not currently implemented).

2014-08-03 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * docs/guide-libgedathon.html: Fixed numerous grammatical errors in
          documentation, minor rephrasing to improved clarity or conciseness.

2014-08-02 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * *: Redo entire API library and modules allow pins number
          as string, rather than integers, in libgeda.

2014-07-25 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * src/*/*.c: Redo inclusion of header files

2014-07-24 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * /src/libgedathon.c: Replace mkdir with f_create_path in function
          PyGeda_open_page and modified error message to include reason path
          creation failed. Not changing library revision because the change
          is insignificant.

2014-07-21 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

        * *: More work on Doxygen documentation; Changed group delimiters to
          use a different style than function documentation, add and end group
          use the double asterisk, as oppose to the asterisk exclamation pair
          so as to allow independent indexing and while searching documentation
          comments.

2014-07-12 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>

	*: Redu .gitignore files

2010-10-26 Wiley E. Hill <wileyhill@gmail.com>
