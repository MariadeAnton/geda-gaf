     *: Continuing development of new renderer, picture images now functional
        for all supported image formats, though maybe Molasses Renderer, needs
        more work. All primary objects are now working, secondary objects like
        markers are absent and no anti-aliasing, so somewhat ugly.

     *: Continuing development of new renderer, add font routines as needed to
        set and restore the basic font configuration.

     *: Switch code base to c++ to improve performance (by having an object rather
        than procedural - and yet another G-object is out of the question. Cpp also
        allows for better handling of X11 errors.)

     *: New library libgedadraw created to provide a higher quality replacement for
        libgedacario, the quality of cario based graphic is deplorable and the quality
        of the pango routines are even worst.
